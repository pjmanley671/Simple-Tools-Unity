# Unity-Simple_Pluggable_Tools
Unity Version: 2018.2.11f1
My Development of simple pluggable tools for Unity.

This is an open repository and open for copying file information. I just ask for the original author comments be left in, so long as no major changes are done to these scripts, otherwise you may do as you please to them on your own systems. I would like to recieve user feedback about possible adaptations that they would like to see. Though I won't promise anything on that front.
