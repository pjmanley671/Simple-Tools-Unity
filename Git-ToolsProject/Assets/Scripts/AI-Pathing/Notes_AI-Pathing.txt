PathPoint.cs
Path.cs
PathGUI.cs

The PathGUI.cs is an editor script and thus must be placed into an Editor folder.

Path.cs is a ScriptableObject. To create an instance simply right click in the project window
then go to Create and it should be up towards the top of the next list.

Create -> AI - Path

Another way is to click Assets in the toolbar and then click Create and it should still be up towards
the top.

Assets -> Create -> AI - Path
